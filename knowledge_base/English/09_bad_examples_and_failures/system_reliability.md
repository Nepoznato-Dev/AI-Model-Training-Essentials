# System Reliability Issues

This document consolidates reliability issues including memory leaks, race conditions, concurrent programming errors, and system design failures.

## Memory Leaks

Memory leaks occur when programs allocate memory but fail to release it when no longer needed, causing gradual memory consumption growth.

### Forgotten Event Listeners

**Bad Example (JavaScript):**
```javascript
// VULNERABLE: Event listener never removed
class Component {
    constructor(element) {
        this.element = element;
        this.data = new Array(1000000).fill('large data');
        
        // Listener added but never removed
        window.addEventListener('resize', this.handleResize.bind(this));
    }
    
    handleResize() {
        console.log('Resized', this.data.length);
    }
    
    destroy() {
        // Forgot to remove event listener!
        this.element.remove();
        // Component "destroyed" but listener still references it
        // Memory cannot be garbage collected
    }
}
```

**Better Approach:**
```javascript
class Component {
    constructor(element) {
        this.element = element;
        this.data = new Array(1000000).fill('large data');
        this.boundHandleResize = this.handleResize.bind(this);
        
        window.addEventListener('resize', this.boundHandleResize);
    }
    
    handleResize() {
        console.log('Resized', this.data.length);
    }
    
    destroy() {
        // Properly clean up
        window.removeEventListener('resize', this.boundHandleResize);
        this.element.remove();
        this.data = null;  // Allow garbage collection
    }
}
```

### Unclosed Resources

**Bad Example (Python):**
```python
def process_files(file_paths):
    results = []
    for path in file_paths:
        f = open(path, 'r')  # Never closed!
        content = f.read()
        results.append(process(content))
        # File handle leaked
    return results
```

**Better Approach:**
```python
def process_files(file_paths):
    results = []
    for path in file_paths:
        with open(path, 'r') as f:  # Automatically closed
            content = f.read()
            results.append(process(content))
    return results
```

### Circular References

**Bad Example (Python):**
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.parent = None
        self.children = []
    
    def add_child(self, child):
        child.parent = self  # Creates circular reference
        self.children.append(child)

# Creating tree structure
root = Node('root')
child = Node('child')
root.add_child(child)

# When deleting root, child keeps reference to root
# When deleting child, root keeps reference to child
# Neither can be garbage collected (in some languages)
```

**Solution:** Use weak references for back-references
```python
import weakref

class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self._parent_ref = None
        self.children = []
    
    @property
    def parent(self):
        if self._parent_ref:
            return self._parent_ref()
        return None
    
    @parent.setter
    def parent(self, node):
        self._parent_ref = weakref.ref(node) if node else None
```

## Race Conditions

Race conditions occur when software behavior depends on the relative timing of events, such as thread execution order.

### Check-Then-Act Race Condition

**Bad Example (Python):**
```python
# VULNERABLE: Check and act are not atomic
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.balance = balance
        self.lock = threading.Lock()
    
    def withdraw(self, amount):
        # RACE CONDITION: Another thread can modify balance between check and act
        if self.balance >= amount:  # Check
            time.sleep(0.001)  # Context switch opportunity
            self.balance -= amount  # Act
            return True
        return False
```

**Problem Scenario:**
```
Initial balance: $100
Thread A: withdraw($80) - checks balance (100 >= 80 ✓)
Thread B: withdraw($50) - checks balance (100 >= 50 ✓)
Thread A: withdraws $80 (balance = $20)
Thread B: withdraws $50 (balance = -$30)  # OVERDRAFT!
```

**Better Approach:**
```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.balance = balance
        self.lock = threading.Lock()
    
    def withdraw(self, amount):
        with self.lock:  # Atomic operation
            if self.balance >= amount:
                self.balance -= amount
                return True
            return False
```

### Read-Modify-Write Race Condition

**Bad Example:**
```python
# VULNERABLE: Counter increment is not atomic
counter = 0

def increment():
    global counter
    temp = counter      # Read
    temp = temp + 1     # Modify
    counter = temp      # Write

# Multiple threads calling increment() will lose updates
```

**Better Approach:**
```python
from threading import Lock

counter = 0
counter_lock = Lock()

def increment():
    global counter
    with counter_lock:
        counter += 1  # Atomic operation
```

### Lazy Initialization Race Condition

**Bad Example:**
```python
# VULNERABLE: Double-checked locking without proper synchronization
class Singleton:
    _instance = None
    
    @classmethod
    def get_instance(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:  # First check (unlocked)
            cls._instance = cls()   # RACE: Multiple threads can create instances
        return cls._instance
```

**Better Approach:**
```python
class Singleton:
    _instance = None
    _lock = threading.Lock()
    
    @classmethod
    def get_instance(cls):
        with cls._lock:
            if cls._instance is None:
                cls._instance = cls()
            return cls._instance
```

## Concurrency Anti-Patterns

### Deadlock

**Bad Example:**
```python
# Thread 1:                    # Thread 2:
lock_a.acquire()               lock_b.acquire()
lock_b.acquire()  # WAIT       lock_a.acquire()  # WAIT
# DEADLOCK - both threads waiting forever
```

**Prevention:** Always acquire locks in a consistent order
```python
# Both threads:
lock_a.acquire()
lock_b.acquire()
# ... critical section ...
lock_b.release()
lock_a.release()
```

### Livelock

**Bad Example:**
```python
# Two threads trying to be polite
while task_not_complete:
    if other_thread_working:
        yield()  # Let other thread go first
    else:
        start_working()
    
    # Both threads keep yielding to each other
    # No progress is made
```

### Starvation

**Bad Example:**
```python
# High-priority tasks constantly preempt low-priority tasks
# Low-priority task never gets CPU time
```

**Solution:** Use fair scheduling or priority aging

## Performance Issues

### N+1 Query Problem

**Bad Example:**
```python
# Fetch all users
users = db.query("SELECT * FROM users")

# N+1 queries: one query per user to get their orders
for user in users:
    orders = db.query("SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = ?", user.id)
    user.orders = orders
```

**Better Approach:**
```python
# Fetch all users
users = db.query("SELECT * FROM users")
user_ids = [u.id for u in users]

# Single query for all orders
orders = db.query(
    "SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id IN (?)",
    user_ids
)

# Group orders by user
orders_by_user = group_by(orders, 'user_id')
for user in users:
    user.orders = orders_by_user.get(user.id, [])
```

### Inefficient Loops

**Bad Example:**
```python
# O(n²) complexity
def find_duplicates(items):
    duplicates = []
    for i in range(len(items)):
        for j in range(len(items)):
            if i != j and items[i] == items[j]:
                duplicates.append(items[i])
    return duplicates
```

**Better Approach:**
```python
# O(n) complexity
def find_duplicates(items):
    seen = set()
    duplicates = set()
    for item in items:
        if item in seen:
            duplicates.add(item)
        else:
            seen.add(item)
    return list(duplicates)
```

## Best Practices Summary

### Memory Management
1. **Use RAII**: Resource Acquisition Is Initialization pattern
2. **Context Managers**: Use `with` statements for resources
3. **Weak References**: For caches and back-references
4. **Profiling**: Regular memory profiling in production

### Concurrency
1. **Minimize Shared State**: Prefer message passing
2. **Use High-Level Abstractions**: Thread pools, async/await
3. **Lock Ordering**: Prevent deadlocks with consistent ordering
4. **Test Concurrently**: Use stress tests and race detectors

### Performance
1. **Profile First**: Measure before optimizing
2. **Algorithm Choice**: Select appropriate data structures
3. **Batch Operations**: Reduce round trips to databases/APIs
4. **Caching**: Cache expensive computations appropriately
