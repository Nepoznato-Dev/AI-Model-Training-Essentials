# Visual Basic — Common Mistakes & Anti-Patterns

This document catalogs the most common mistakes, traps, and anti-patterns in Visual Basic (VB.NET) with corrections.

---

## 1. Not Disposing Resources

```vb
' ❌ WRONG — resource leak
Dim reader As New StreamReader("data.txt")
Dim data As String = reader.ReadToEnd()
reader.Close()  ' skipped if ReadToEnd throws

' ✅ CORRECT — Using block
Using reader As New StreamReader("data.txt")
    Dim data As String = reader.ReadToEnd()
End Using  ' automatically disposed
```

---

## 2. `=` vs `Is` for Object Comparison

```vb
' ❌ WRONG — = for reference comparison
Dim a As Object = "hello"
Dim b As Object = "hello"
If a = b Then  ' value comparison, not reference
If a Is b Then  ' reference comparison
End If

' ✅ CORRECT — use Is for reference, = for value
If name = "Alice" Then  ' string value comparison
If obj1 Is obj2 Then    ' same object?
If obj1 Is Nothing Then ' null check
End If
```

---

## 3. Option Strict Off

```vb
' ❌ WRONG — late binding and implicit conversions
Option Strict Off
Dim x As Integer = "42"  ' implicit conversion
Dim obj As Object = "hello"
Dim len As Integer = obj.Length  ' late binding

' ✅ CORRECT — enable Option Strict
Option Strict On
Dim x As Integer = Integer.Parse("42")
Dim s As String = "hello"
Dim len As Integer = s.Length
```

---

## 4. Not Using `Using` for Database Connections

```vb
' ❌ WRONG — connection not closed on error
Dim conn As New SqlConnection(connString)
conn.Open()
Dim cmd As New SqlCommand("SELECT * FROM Users", conn)
Dim reader As SqlDataReader = cmd.ExecuteReader()
' ... use reader ...
conn.Close()  ' never reached on exception

' ✅ CORRECT — nested Using blocks
Using conn As New SqlConnection(connString)
    conn.Open()
    Using cmd As New SqlCommand("SELECT * FROM Users", conn)
        Using reader As SqlDataReader = cmd.ExecuteReader()
            ' ... use reader ...
        End Using
    End Using
End Using
```

---

## 5. Anti-Pattern: Business Logic in Event Handlers

```vb
' ❌ WRONG — everything in button click
Private Sub btnSave_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs)
    ' validation, database access, email, all here
End Sub

' ✅ CORRECT — separate concerns
Private Sub btnSave_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs)
    UserService.Save(txtName.Text, txtEmail.Text)
End Sub
```

---

## Summary

VB.NET traps: always use `Using` for disposable resources, distinguish `=` (value) from `Is` (reference), enable `Option Strict On`, use `Using` blocks for database connections, and separate business logic from UI event handlers. Modern VB.NET is a powerful .NET language — use its features properly.
