# Scratch — Common Mistakes & Anti-Patterns

This document catalogs the most common mistakes and traps in Scratch with corrections.

---

## 1. Not Using "Stop" to End Scripts

```
❌ WRONG — script keeps running after game over
when green flag clicked
forever
    if <touching [edge v]?> then
        say [Game Over]
        // script continues!
    end
end

✅ CORRECT — use stop block
when green flag clicked
forever
    if <touching [edge v]?> then
        say [Game Over]
        stop [all v]
    end
end
```

---

## 2. Clone Confusion

```
❌ WRONG — modifying original sprite thinking it's a clone
when I start as a clone
change [score v] by (1)  // modifies global variable
// but "when green flag clicked" also runs on clones!

✅ CORRECT — separate clone logic from original
when green flag clicked
// setup code only

when I start as a clone
// clone-specific behavior only
```

---

## 3. Broadcast Timing

```
❌ WRONG — expecting immediate response
broadcast [jump v]
// code continues immediately, doesn't wait!

✅ CORRECT — use broadcast and wait
broadcast [jump v] and wait
// now waits for all recipients to finish
```

---

## 4. Variable Scope

```
❌ WRONG — using global variable when local needed
// All sprites share the variable "my variable"
// Sprite A changes it, Sprite B sees the change

✅ CORRECT — use "For this sprite only"
// Create variable as "For this sprite only"
// Each sprite has its own copy
```

---

## 5. Infinite Loops Without Yield

```
❌ WRONG — freezes the program
when green flag clicked
forever
    // no wait or visual change
    // locks up the interface
end

✅ CORRECT — add a small wait
when green flag clicked
forever
    // do work
    wait (0.1) seconds
end
```

---

## Summary

Scratch traps: always use "stop" to end games, separate clone logic from original sprite logic, use "broadcast and wait" for synchronous communication, use sprite-specific variables when needed, and add waits in forever loops to prevent freezing. Scratch teaches fundamental concepts — respect the event-driven model.
