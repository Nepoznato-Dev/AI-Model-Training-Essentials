# Ada — Common Mistakes & Anti-Patterns

This document catalogs the most common mistakes, traps, and anti-patterns in Ada with corrections.

---

## 1. Not Using `pragma Strict`

```ada
-- ❌ WRONG — allowing implicit conversions
X : Integer := 3.14;  -- may compile with warnings

-- ✅ CORRECT — strict mode catches issues
pragma Strict;
X : Integer := 3.14;  -- compile error: type mismatch
```

---

## 2. Range Errors on Subtypes

```ada
-- ❌ WRONG — assuming subtype checks at compile time
type Day is range 1 .. 31;
D : Day := 32;  -- Constraint_Error at runtime

-- ✅ CORRECT — validate input
D : Day := Day'Value(Input);
exception
   when Constraint_Error => Put_Line("Invalid day");
```

---

## 3. Not Using Named Parameters for Readability

```ada
-- ❌ WRONG — positional parameters
Create(File, Out_File, "data.txt");

-- ✅ CORRECT — named association
Create(File => File, Mode => Out_File, Name => "data.txt");
```

---

## 4. Forgetting to Handle Exceptions

```ada
-- ❌ WRONG — no exception handling
procedure Process is
   F : File_Type;
begin
   Open(F, In_File, "data.txt");
   -- use F...
end Process;
-- raises Name_Error if file doesn't exist

-- ✅ CORRECT — handle exceptions
procedure Process is
   F : File_Type;
begin
   Open(F, In_File, "data.txt");
   -- use F...
   Close(F);
exception
   when Name_Error => Put_Line("File not found");
   when others => Put_Line("Unexpected error");
end Process;
```

---

## 5. Task Deadlock

```ada
-- ❌ WRONG — tasks waiting on each other
task A is
   entry Start;
end A;
task body A is
begin
   B.Start;  -- waits for B
   accept Start do null; end Start;  -- B waits for A
end A;

-- ✅ CORRECT — design task communication carefully
-- Use protected objects for shared state
protected Counter is
   function Get return Integer;
   procedure Increment;
private
   Value : Integer := 0;
end Counter;
```

---

## Summary

Ada's strong typing prevents many bugs but requires discipline: use `pragma Strict`, handle `Constraint_Error` for subtypes, use named parameter association for readability, always handle exceptions, and design task communication carefully to avoid deadlock. Ada rewards careful, safety-conscious programming.
